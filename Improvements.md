I wrote about improvements to highlight your ability to identify areas for enhancement and implement solutions to drive positive change and achieve better outcomes within projects or organizations.

<br><br>

**1. Improvement - product pictures**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current: </i></b> Every product on this webshop has a picture that is too small. Also if the user is located on any product page, picture(s) that appear can not be zoomed in.<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b>On a page where all products appear increase the picture size. On the product page allow users to zoom in on image.<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> Users will faster determine what the product looks like. User will be able to see details of the product with a zoom in feature. <br>

**2. Improvement - available quantity**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current: </i></b> When the user is located in a category page where filters are present (f.e. LED diode page) and if the user wants to filter by any attribute, wants to see filtered products ‘Pronadji’ button must be clicked.<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b> Refresh products every time the change has been in the filter box without having to press the button ‘Pronadji’.<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> It would make search easier because products and filters would be automatically updated. Also It would save users time by eliminating the need to click the "Pronadji" button after each filter change.<br>
<hr>

**3. Improvement - filters**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current: </i></b> When users go through a webshop there is not displayed the available quantity of products.<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b> Allow users to see current inventory status.<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> User will not know if the amount that was ordered is currently available. Adding this feature will save users time with ordering products.<br>
<hr>

**4. Improvement - filters**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current:</i></b> Users are unable to see which filters have been applied after filtering, making it challenging to reset specific filters if needed. The only way to reset filters is by clicking the "Osvezi filter" button, which resets all filters.<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b> Implement a feature that displays a list of selected attributes and allows users to reset individual attributes.<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> This change would provide users with visibility into the applied filters, enabling them to reset specific attributes without resetting all filters so users would not have to redo the entire filtering process when they wish to change a specific attribute, improving efficiency and user experience.<br>
<hr>

**5. Improvement - product names**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current:</i></b> Similar products have dissimilar names, making it difficult for users to identify related items through search. Many product names contain grammatical errors because they do not include characters like "ČĆĐŽ."<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b> Implement universal names for products and ensure that they include letters such as "ČĆĐŽ."<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> Including letters such as "ČĆĐŽ" ensures that product names are accurately represented and free from grammatical errors. When searching with a standardized name, users can expect all related products to appear, ensuring large search results and reducing confusion.<br>
<hr>

**6. Improvement - webshop responsiveness**
<br><br>
<b><i>Current:</i></b> Webshop is not optimized for screens that aren't desktop. For example it is hard for user on mobile phone to navigate through page because text is overflowing.<br>
<b><i>Requested: </i></b> Develop a responsive and adaptable webshop design that ensures optimal usability across all screen sizes and devices.<br>
<b><i>Reason: </i></b> Many users will access the webshop using mobile phone. Making this change will make user experience a lot easier and more pleasant. Adapting the webshop to be responsive and adaptable improves accessibility, usability, and user satisfaction, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.<br>
